Developing Data Products class assignment

These files construct a simple app found at: http://gibarto.shinyapps.io/devdatproj/

This app is built for the Developing Data Products class. It fulfills the following criteria:
1. It includes a user input (radio button)
2. It takes the user input to get data from mtcars and create a linear regression for the data
3. It displays the data in chart form, including the regression line
4. The basic usage of the app is detailed in a short description in the main window
5. This documentation is in the app, not at an external site

An explanation of the app and why it's handy for data science students and bar bets can be found at:
